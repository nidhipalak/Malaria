### Background

Malaria is a vector borne disease that is preventable and curable. The parasite responsible for causing malaria is plasmodium spp. There are 5 known species of this parasite, but P. falciparum and P. vivax pose the greatest risks.  These parasites are carried by the female anopheles mosquito. 

Malaria is more common in regions with high humidity and rainfall. The people at most risk for malaria include
infants, children under 5, pregnant women, HIV/AIDS patients, non-immune migrants, and travelers. The bulk of the disease burden is carried by sub-Saharan Africa as well as the mortality cases.

### Symptoms

Usually, Malaria symptoms appear between 10 to 15 days of infective mosquito bite. Malaria may cause fever, headache and chills. In severe cases, multi-organ failure may occur. Immediate treatment is often required at this stage to prevent the illness from progressing to a more severe state or even death. 

In children, a few additional symptoms may be observed such as severe anaemia, respiratory distress, and /or cerebral malaria. In places where malaria is endemic, it is not uncommon for people to have partial immunity.

### Malaria Eradication

The war against malaria continues to be waged. The eradication of Malaria requires deliberate activities that distorts or breaks the transmission pathway as well as the employment of measures such as surveillance, diagnosis and prompt treatments. In the past few years, some countries is several regions of the world have been able to reduce their indigenous cases to 0 for 3 consecutive years.

Two major concerns in this fight against malaria is the insecticide resistance of some mosquito species and recurring anti-malaria drug resistance.
