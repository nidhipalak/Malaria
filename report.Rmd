## Motivation
Although America is not a malaria hotspot, according to CDC, half of the world's population lives in high risk malaria transmission regions. Our interest in Malaria stems from our individual experiences with Malaria has most of us have ties to countries that have high prevalence of Malaria. In exploring different data sets we found some interesting patterns. Most importantly, we found that Malaria can be eradicated even in countries that are current hot spots if proper preventive measures are followed.


Malaria is a vector borne disease that is preventable and curable. The parasite responsible for causing malaria is Plasmodium _spp_. These parasites are carried by the female anopheles mosquito. Malaria is more common in regions with high humidity and rainfall. The people at most risk for malaria include; infants, children under 5, pregnant women, HIV/AIDS patients, non-immune migrants, and travelers.

## Initial questions
The following were initial questions we tried to answer at the beginning. 

*   What is the relationship between species of mosquitoes? 
    *   Can we visualize evolution of species over time?
    *   Is there overlap of mosquito species?
    *   Is the proportion of mosquito species the same across all continents?
    *   Do the rates of evolution change over time (how long were a species dominant during a time period?)
*   Trends over years
    *   Heat, precipitation, vegetation, etc over a year with mosquito prevalence/malaria incidence
*   Do areas with higher sickle cell traits have less malaria incidence?
*   Compare time periods

Potential ideas:

*   Climate change and mosquito prevalence
*   Relation of species genotypes 
*   Health education
*   Topography
*   Drop in malaria incidence with introduction of interventions (nets, etc)
*   Severity of malaria in relation to species/time  

### Reasons why we ask those questions



## Data: Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.

### Explore Cases

### Causes
For vectors (mosquitos) and parasites of Malaria. We used vectors data from Malaria Atlas Project and parasites data from WHO. The Malaria Atlas data was tidied, so we only need filtered out countries of interest. The WHO data needed to be cleaned up. The original data had 11 variables: Country/area, year, 2010 to 2018 (each year was one variable). The final data contained four variables: country, species, years, and cases. Only P. falciparum and P.vivax were remained because they were major causes of malaria.

### Correlations

### Interventions



## Exploratory analysis

### Explore Cases

### Causes
Since the mosquito species data had small sample size (< 30 for most species) and not consistent across years, we used map to visualize cumulative number of different mosquito species for Africa and Asia. Most malaria cases were diagnosed in these regions. For confirmed cases by parasite species, we plotted line plots of confirmed cases by P. falciparum in countries of interest, from 2010 to 2018, since it was the dominant causes of malaria for most countries. Additionally, a plot for confirmed cases by P. vivax in India because only India had consistent data for both P. falciparum and P. vivax, and the numbers were quite similar.
