**Tentative title**

Team Malaria (we’re workshoping it)

**The motivation**

Although America is not a malaria hotspot, half of the world’s
population lives in high risk malaria transmission regions. To this end,
we seek to link and explore the interplay of various variables that
contribute to this phenomenon. We intend to explore the geographic and
climatic impact on mosquito species and by extension malaria. With the
core understanding that understanding malaria also involves
understanding Anopheles mosquito species which are vectors of the
disease. We found a great dataset that catalogs malaria incidence,
mosquito prevalence, mosquito species, among other variables. *We hope
to update the information that the class (and public) has about malaria
and its vectors, and call attention rising risk of the evolution of
resistant Anopheles mosquito species* We found mosquito species and its
causal relationship to malaria, demographics, and other species to be
interesting as well\!

**The intended final products**

  - What is the relationship between species of mosquitoes?
      - Can we visualize evolution of species over time?
      - Is there overlap of mosquito species?
      - Is the proportion of mosquito species the same across all
        continents?
      - Do the rates of evolution change over time (how long were a
        species dominant during a time period?)
  - Trends over years
      - Heat, precipitation, vegetation, etc over a year with mosquito
        prevalence/malaria incidence
  - Do areas with higher sickle cell traits have less malaria incidence?
  - Compare time periods

Potential ideas:

  - Climate change and mosquito prevalence
  - Relation of species genotypes
  - Health education
  - Topography
  - Drop in malaria incidence with introduction of interventions (nets,
    etc)
  - Severity of malaria in relation to species/time

Parasites](https://malariaatlas.org/api-docs/) <br> [Malaria Atlas

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**

  - Planned analysis
      - We want to see the proportion of mosquito species across the
        different continent and relationship to malaria incidence
  - Visualizations
      - A time series (2000-2017) world map with mosquito species
        prevalence
          - Maybe screenshots of year to year or a more smooth graphic?
      - Incidence of malaria
      - Genealogy of mosquito species
      - Relationship with climate and malaria transmission
  - Coding challenge
      - We want to create a genotype mapping visual of mosquito species.
        We have not found an available dataset with this data. Our
        potential solution is to use Selector Gadget and pull
        information from Wikipedia, which sounds tedious.  
      - Time series world map
      - Missing data

**The planned timeline**

  - Bi-weekly team meetings
  - Steps:
      - Nov 7-10: Clean data
          - Nov 11 meeting: Clean data, test out visualizations on
            Madagascar
      - Nov 11-16: Build visualizations
      - Nov 17-19: Clean up visualizations
      - Nov 20-21: Layout
      - Nov 22-25: Write report; tell a story
      - Nov 28-30: Make presentation
      - Dec 1-4: Record
