Proposal
================
Team Malaria
11/6/2020

**The group members**

Wura Olawole (wo2179) Hanfei Qi (hq2182) Murrel Pereira (mwp2123) Laura
Gomez Merchan (lcg2154) Nidhi Patel (np2619)

**Tentative title**

**The motivation**

Malaria is not too common in America.

**The intended final products**

  - what is the relationship between species of mosquitoes
      - can we visualize evolution of species over time?
      - is there overlap of mosquito species?
      - is the proportion of mosquito species the same across all
        continents?
      - do the rates of evolution change over time (how long were a
        species dominant during a time period?)
  - trends over years
  - sickle cell overlapping malaria rates
  - compare time periods

Potential ideas:

  - climate change and mosquito prevalence
  - relation of species genotypes
  - compare how
  - health education
  - topography

**The anticipated data sources**
