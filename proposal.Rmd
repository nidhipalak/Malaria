**The group members**

Wura Olawole (wo2179) <br>
Hanfei Qi (hq2182)<br>

Nidhi Patel (np2619)<br>

**Tentative title**


**The motivation**

Malaria is not common in America.  

**The intended final products**

*   what is the relationship between species of mosquitoes 
    *   can we visualize evolution of species over time?
    *   is there overlap of mosquito species?
    *   is the proportion of mosquito species the same across all continents?
    *   do the rates of evolution change over time (how long were a species dominant during a time period?)
*   trends over years
    *   heat, precipitation, vegetation, etc over a year with mosquito prevalence/malaria incidence
*   do areas with higher sickle cell traits have less malaria incidence?
*   compare time periods

Potential ideas:

*   climate change and mosquito prevalence
*   relation of species genotypes 
*   health education
*   topography
*   drop in malaria incidence with introduction of interventions (nets, etc)
*   severity of malaria in relation to species/time

**The anticipated data sources**

[Malaria Atlas](https://malariaatlas.org/api-docs/) <br>
[Malaria Atlas Mortality](https://malariaatlas.org/malaria-burden-data-download/)



**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**

*   Planned analysis
    * we want to see the proportion of mosquito species across the different continent and relationship to malaria incidence
*   Visualizations
    * a time series world map with mosquito species prevalence 
*   Coding challenge
    *   we want to create a genotype mapping visual of mosquito species. We have not found an available dataset with this data. Our potential solution is to use Selector Gadget and pull information from Wikipedia, which sounds tedious.  

**The planned timeline**

*   weekly team meetings
